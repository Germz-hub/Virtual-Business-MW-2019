In order to **make changes** to your website, you need to learn some of the basic Markdown syntax.

The syntax includes: 

1. heading

2. bold

3. italic

4. blockquote

5. ordered list

6. unordered list

7. code

8. horizontal rule

9. link

10. image

**1 thing to keep in mind is no space between the text and the symbol**

For heading, you need to put a hashtag before the text #H1, #H2, #H3

For bold, you need to put 2 asterisks before the text and after it as well.

To illustrate: **bold**

Italic only requires 1 asterisk and again 1 asterisk after the text to close it.

For example: *italic*

Blockquote is simple. You only need a > before the text.

>blockquote

We have 2 types of lists:

- ordered list

- unordered list

Ordered list starts with numbering the items such as

1. First item

2. Second item

3. Third item

Unordered list begins with a dash.

- First item

- Second item

For code, we put ` before the text and after the text.

`code`

Horizontal rule just needs dashes

--------------

In order to make a link, just put a bracket before the text and after the text then a parenthesis before the URL then close it with a parenthesis.

[google](www.google.com)

If you want to attach an image, just put a bracket before the text and after the text then a parenthesis then put the text and a dot jpg and close with a parenthesis.
